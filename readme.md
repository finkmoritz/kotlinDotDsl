# Kotlin DOT DSL

## Overview

**[DOT](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html)** is a **Domain Specific Language (DSL)** that is used in the **Graphviz - Graph Visualization Software**
to describe graphs. A graph is an ensemble of nodes connected by edges.

This project aims to mimic this language using various features of the _Kotlin_ language.
